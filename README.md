<h1>FeetWasher</h1>

<h3>Background</h3>

As a member of several churches over a number of years, one thing that always seems to come up is a disconnect between people that need help and other members who would love to help, but simply had no idea there was a need. There are elderly people who need lawn care, physically disabled people who just need a ride to appointments and even young couples who could use an extra hand or two moving into their new house.

Inspired by the church in Acts, who demonstrated what it was like to live in true community, I wanted to build a space where people could communicate those needs and fill them for others. Knowing that this platform could bring a church together in love and service, I decided to add prayer requests to the existing service forum. In all, my hope is greater than that of needs being met; my hope is that authentic community is reborn.

Okay, but why the funny name?

The name "FeetWasher" is inspired by the practice of washing feet in Biblical times. Because people back then wore sandals around all day, their feet would often get pretty gross. It was no wonder they considered feet the dirtiest part of the body and expected them to be washed off before entering a home. Jesus, the Lord and Savior of this world, shocked everyone when He decided to humbly kneel and wash the feet of others in an ultimate demonstration of selfless service. Not only did he exemplify this service, but He also commanded us to do the same. In other words, He wants us to be a FeetWasher!


<h3>Planning</h3>

<h5>User Stories</h5>
<ul>
    <li><em>As a user, I want to be able to create new requests. One request belongs to one user. A user can have multiple requests.</em></li>
    <li><em>As a user, I want to be able to see all of the church's requests.</em></li>
    <li><em>As a user, I want to be able to comment on other people's requests. One request can have multiple comments, but all comments belong to one request.</em></li>
    <li><em>As a user, I want to be able to update my request.</em></li>
    <li><em>As a user, I want to be able to delete my request.</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

Some features I'd like to add in the future in order to further enhance the user experience include:
<ul>
    <li>Sort the index page requests from most recent to oldest.</li>
    <li>An anonymous option for the new prayer request form, for those that want to retain some privacy.</li>
    <li>Add a prayer emoji to the prayer requests so that others can know you are praying without having to comment, similar to a "like" button.</li>
    <li>Show the edit comment text box only after the edit comment button is clicked.</li>
    <li>Additional CSS Styling</li>
</ul>
